# Mixxx controller mappings for Allen Heath Xone:K2 + Midi Fighter Twister

I use a slightly different mapping then the new 2.1 mixxx default mapping 
for the K2 together with a Midi Fighter Twister.

Bottom buttons are assigned differently for the purpose of extremly fast navigation and prelistening.

## K2 Changes

| Button | Modifier | Function |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Right  | | Load into preview deck |
| Left press | | Pause/Unpause preview deck |
| Left rotate | | fast skips through the preview deck |
| Left rotate + press | shift | adjust master bpm |
| Left rotate + press |       | Headphone mix |

## Midi Twister

The design is still in development.

The midi twister configuration needs to be uploaded once.
The twister is used for effects and volume adjustments.
